            <h2>ABOUT THIS SITE</h2>
            <p1>
                To build a solid foundation of the fundementals of web development, I developed this site using the
                vanilla technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is also done to minimize maintenance and maximize
                compatibility.
                <br><br>
                I always liked the look of technology from before my time or electronics that were more prominent during
                my childhood. Such things like you see above like CRT TVs, VHS tapes, and old computers. I think these
                things take you back to a time where technology was new and exciting and it also gives me an excuse to
                let this website look bad because nearly all websites looked bad in the golden age.

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p1>
                Squigley is a platforming game where you explore a massive 2D world, overcoming difficult obstacles
                using unique movement
                mechanics. The game was launched on Steam in August of 2024 after a year in development.
            </p1>
            <h2>Developing Squigley</h2>
            <h3><i>Technologies used: C#, Unity</i></h3>
            <p1>
                I've developed Squigley during my first year in college. It started out as a very simple
                project to tinker around with Unity. It uses C#, which is a very similar language to Java, which I was
                currently taking
                and intro class for. As I was just learning how to program, there's a lot of atrocities in this
                codebase. Look closely
                at the GitHub repo and you can probably spot a good few flaws. I got better at programming as the
                project went on, but
                making the game taught me many pitfalls to avoid through firsthand experience.
                <br><br>
                Though I didn't have much experience with video game art and music at the time, I created all of the art
                and most of the
                music on my own. The only exception to this was the "true-ending" credits song "Cattails", which I
                recorded with some of
                my high school friends that I was in a band with. I did this because I wanted the game to have a
                cohesive art-style.
                Though it was all very ametuer, I was happy with the result.
                <br><br>
                After launch, the game recieved a few updates to address user feedback and bug fixes. The game was
                obviously not a huge
                success, but I wanted to make it as complete and as good as possible. The game went free-to-play in
                January of 2025.

            <p1>Shorty Shooters is an online multiplayer 2-Dimensional shooter game. The objective is to get the
                most kills by staying in the ring and shooting your opponent while they're vulnerable. Where the game
                shines is its unique movement mechanics, where you can use the gun's recoil in order to launch yourself
                further.
            </p1>
            <h2>Developing Shorty Shooters</h2>
            <h3><i>Technologies Used: Godot, GDScript</i></h3>
            <p1>
                Shorty Shooters was developed as a part of <a href="https://huskygames.com/">Husky Game Development</a>,
                an organization at Michigan Technological University. The project took place over the course of one
                semester, as many of the six group members didn't have space in their schedules to continue with the
                project. I contributed mostly to programming the core gameplay loop and refining basic features like
                movement and shooting, while also doing some of the environmental art and character spritework. In this
                project, you can see the progress I've made in programming, game design, and pixel art since Squigley.
                <br><br>
                Some updates have been made since the end of the semester the game was created, but all team members
                have moved on to work on other projects. You can download the game for free on <a
                    href="https://huskygamedev.itch.io/shorty-shooters">itch.io</a> if you'd like to try it out.

            <h1>About</h1>
            <p1>
                I am currently a computer science student at Michigan Technological University expecting to graduate in
                2027. I was born in Ann Arbor, MI and grew up in the area until I graduated high school in 2023.
                Currently, I am looking for new opportunities to contribute to a team, so if you're an employer
                impressed by any of the projects on this site I threw together, please get in touch!
                <br><br>
                Some other things about me: I've played bass and guitar for a while and was a part of two rock bands and
                I occasionally record some music. I also enjoy weight lifting and skateboarding and have also been
                getting into snowboarding this past winter.
                <br><br>
                Fun fact: my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@turbojaykay3365">YouTube</a> channel has nearly <i>1
                    million</i>
                views combined from all videos, though most of the views are from a stupid meme I uploaded years ago and
                still gains some traction every now and then. I also put some of my projects there, so subscribe if
                you'd like to see other stuff I work on.
